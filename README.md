# News Mining
Analysing the top trends in news from news headlines from ABC news Australia.

The data contains news headlines from ABC news Australia.

## Tools used:-
   - Pycharm (Community Edition)
   - Numpy
   - Panda
   - Matplotlib
   - sklearn 

## Algorithm used:-

I have used the [k-means cluster algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering#Standard_algorithm) to calculate the most common words to find out what the news headlines were about.

## Observation:-

Using the tf-idf approach, the following words were the most common amongst the various headlines:-

 polic, say, plan, investig, probe, council, govt, offic, search, hunt, death, attack, car, drug, arrest, water, miss, seek, shoot, minist, driver, union, need, crash, hous
 charg, man, murder, face, assault, drug, polic, child, sex, woman, court, teen, death, stab, drop, alleg, rape, men, attack, guilti, bail, shoot, sydney, fatal, driver
